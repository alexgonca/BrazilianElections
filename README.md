Brazilian Elections
===================

Ongoing project with the newspaper "O Estado de S. Paulo" to improve the consistency of historical data about candidates in Brazilian elections.

The Electoral Court in Brazil provides [different databases](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais) for each election cicle. In the past few years, there has been a significant improvement in the quality of the data. However, the previous databases are still plaged with inconsistencies that make hard comparisons or historical analysis.

This project tries to delineate a consistent approach to deal with those inconsistencies.

The approach proposed here (and demonstrated with the candidates' data) is to correct the inconsistencies with shell scripts and then import them to a MySQL database.
